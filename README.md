# LA Crime Spatiotemporal Analysis (2021–2023)

## 📌 Overview  
This project analyzes **561,000+ crime records** from the LAPD to identify spatial hotspots, temporal trends, and demographic patterns. Key insights include crime zone prioritization, peak crime hours, and victim demographics, enabling data-driven public safety strategies.

## 🔍 Key Features  
- **Geospatial Analysis**: K-Means clustering (57% silhouette score) and MDS to map crime hotspots.  
- **Temporal Trends**: Heatmaps revealing violent crimes spike at **midnight on weekends** (15%↑).  
- **Demographics**: Latinx identified as most targeted group (35% victims).  
- **Tools**: Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn), Tableau, choropleth maps, and heatmaps.  

## 📂 Data Sources  
- **LAPD OpenData**: 2021–2023 crime records with 28 attributes (location, time, victim details).  
- **UCR Compstat**: Crime classification and MO code reference files.  

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies  
- **Languages**: Python  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Visualization**: Tableau, MDS, K-Means, Word Clouds  
- **Data Cleaning**: Duplicate removal, missing value handling, feature engineering.  

## 🔑 Key Findings  
- **Top Crime Zones**: Central and 77th Street areas (30%+ crime density).  
- **Reporting Gaps**: 30% of property crimes reported late vs. 50% same-day for violent crimes.  
- **Impact**: Insights guided LAPD patrol schedules and resource allocation.
